# smarthome
A smart home implementation designed with privacy, security, simplicity and production-grade stability in mind.

## Dependencies
1. Clang (C++17)
1. CMake 3.14
1. Googletest

## Goals
Looking into the future it seems like there will be demand for a privacy-centric smarthome implementation
giving users the ability to adapt the system to their taste. Just as linux provides users that flexibility
in the realm of the operating system I believe that similar desires will surface in the smarthome domain.
This project aims to provide that system along with the production-readiness that comes with a stable
proprietary implementation. I've seen systems that are heavily DIY-centric but this project aims to provide
simplicity so that users don't have to be experts to set the system up.
